**demo setup**

Using the ADE9078, our group created a PCB and wrote firmware to create a small
portable three phase wattmeter. Our demo setup was designed to detect faults in
a three phase motor. By performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the power
data and looking for irregularities, we were able to determine if the motor was
faulty.

My primary contribution was configuring the waveform buffer firmware and
creating a graphical interface for FFT.
