title: Using Neovim as a Fennel Compiler

I've been doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) this year in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org).
(I'm updating my answers every day in [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/enochchau/adventofcode2022).)
I use a few different computers day to day and I need to setup each computer with
the proper Lua libraries and Fennel compiler.
For speed, I want to run the Fennel compiler under LuaJIT and I also want to have
access to the [`inspect.lua`](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua) library for debugging.
I got everything working alright on MacOS but on Linux, Fennel wasn't detecting
luarocks libraries.
That's when I realized I don't actually need an extra program to compile and run Fennel.
I already have everything I need built directly into Neovim.

Running Fennel scripts through Neovim gives me access to all of Neovim's builtin APIs.
This is a fantastic environment for debugging and development since a lot of
helper functions already exist. For example `vim.inspect` implements the same
functionality as `inspect.lua` and Neovim even provides a short hand for
printing `vim.inspect`'s results using `vim.pretty_print`.

I already partly setup Neovim as a Fennel compiler in a [previous blog post](/blog/2022/lispy-neovim).
The implementation I originally came up with worked well for compiling a file to output
but what if I want to write that output to stdout instead?
Naively, I initially thought I could just use the `print()` function.

```lua
command("FnlCompile", function(t)
    if debug.traceback ~= fennel.traceback then
        debug.traceback = fennel.traceback
    end

    local in_path, out_path = unpack(vim.fn.split(t.args, " "))
    assert(in_path, "missing input path")

    local stream = open_stream(in_path)
    local out = fnl_compile(stream)

    if out_path ~= nil then
        local file = assert(io.open(out_path, "w"))
        file:write(out)
        file:close()
    else
        -- if no file path is provided lets just print the contents
        print(out)
    end
end, { nargs = 1 })
```

<div style="margin: 1rem" />

```bash
FENNEL_COMPILE=true nvim --headless -c "FnlCompile test.fnl" +q
```

But then I ran into an issue: `print` doesn't print to stdout when this command is run.
No matter how I redirected the output, I couldn't get
the it to print to stdout.
A quick search, helped me find this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4772#issuecomment-219962823).
I found that, you have to explicitly write your output to `/dev/stdout`.
My fix was to create a helper function for printing to stdout.

```lua
local function print_stdout(message)
    message = vim.fn.split(message, "\n")
    vim.fn.writefile(message, "/dev/stdout")
end
```

Now I can print the results of compilation directly to stdout.

I also need to setup a way to run individual Fennel scripts in the Neovim environment.
The Fennel compiler API includes
[a function for evaluation of Fennel files](https://fennel-lang.org/api#evaluate-a-file-of-fennel).
I can expose this function using a simple Neovim command.

```lua
command("FnlRun", function(t)
    local in_path = unpack(vim.fn.split(t.args, " "))
    assert(in_path, "missing input path")

    local out = fennel.dofile(in_path)
    -- print an extra newline to seperate script output from from the printed return values
    print("\n")
    print_stdout(vim.inspect(out))
end, { nargs = 1 })
```

Now I can run a Fennel script using:

```bash
FENNEL_COMPILE=true nvim --headless -c "FnlRun test.fnl" +q
```

This provides a very nice DX.
My goal for using Fennel in Advent of Code is to practice writing future Neovim plugins.
I no longer have to setup Fennel, Lua, or luarocks.
I have my entire compile and run cycle going through Neovim which I already
have installed on all my systems.
