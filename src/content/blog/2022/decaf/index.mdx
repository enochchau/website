I started drinking decaf coffee and it's kinda nice.
Sometimes I just want to have a cup of coffee at 1AM before going to sleep.
I've been able to separate my minds association between caffeine the drug
and coffee the drink.
Usually, I drink coffee in the morning because I want a quick energy boost.
Now I can drink coffee at night just to enjoy the flavor.
I can also drink way more coffee per day which I will happily indulge in.
