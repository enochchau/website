I've been dealing with rejection since the first girl I had a crush on.

<div style="width:100%;">

      alt="Warning! feelings not mutual"
    ></img>
  </a>
</div>

This is my lock screen right now.
It's there to remind me not to get too caught up in my feelings.
So I don't get disappointed with rejection.
But don't be silly, its not just love.

<p style="margin:0;">Getting rejected from colleges.</p>
<p style="margin:0;">Getting rejected from internships.</p>
<p style="margin:0">Getting rejected at career fairs.</p>
<p style="margin:0">Getting rejected from job applications.</p>

I try not to set my expectations too high.
I lie to myself.
I tell myself, "It's not that important".
But dammit if I'm not feverishly praying with my subconscious that it all works out.
