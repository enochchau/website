A collection of recipes from my college days.
It's somewhat nostalgic to look back on these.
Most of these recipes were written during the height of
[Bon Appetit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpMy0Fg74eXXkvxJrtEn3w) and
[Binging with Babish's](https://www.youtube.com/c/bingingwithbabish) popularity on food YouTube.
I would read several recipes online and watch some videos before compiling my notes into my own recipe.
They are written on note cards, grocery receipts, and post it notes.
I still have all the physical copies but they're starting to fade and fall apart with time.
