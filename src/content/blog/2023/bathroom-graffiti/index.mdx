Bathroom graffiti holds a warm place in my heart.
I appreciate it because it represents my connection to creativity
and the people who guided me along the way.
There were a lot of people who were formative to sparking my creativity
but the two people I want to credit the most continuing this streak are
Alex and Avery.
Their patience in giving the time to a high school kid who wasn't sure what
he wanted to do in the world.

Bathroom graffiti was only the start of a reconnection.

- Butterfly effect?
