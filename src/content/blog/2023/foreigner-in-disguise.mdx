I am ambiguously East Asian. Really, try to guess what I'm made of.
Street food Aunties in Ho Chi Minh City would talk to me in Vietnamese.
Bar promoters in Ha Noi would beckon me with Korean.
The clerks at the combini would always address me in Japanese.
And I'd have to disappoint them by using a combination of
"sorry", "hello", or "do you speak English?" so I could complete my transaction.
In Taiwan, I could pretend to be Taiwanese, but eventually 
my American accent and elementary Chinese would expose my disguise.

Sometimes I wonder what it's like traveling in Asia as a White or someone less
ambiguously Asian.
