I want to be good at the things I'm interested in but why do I want to be good at them?
I want to be good because I want other people to see that I'm good.
I need external validation to boost my ego.

I fell into this early on in climbing.
I started climbing because my brother got me into climbing
but I kept climbing because people around me told me I was good at climbing.
At the gym, I was improving quickly, my grades kept going up and that got me psyched.

Climbing grades are the easiest metric to measure skill by.
A question I often get asked by new climbers is "What grade do you climb?".
The higher the grade you climb, the stronger a climber you are.
Being strong is a source of external validation to continue climbing.
Soon enough, I was comparing myself to the people I climbed with.
Was I sending faster than them? Was I able to climb at the same level?
I wanted to be stronger, to prove to those around me that I was strong.

But then I wasn't as strong as them.
My longtime climbing buddy who I always thought as equals slowly surpassed me.
I kept chuffing on boulders my friends had done years before.
I thought to myself "Why can't I do this?". 
That thought bit into my ego and slowly sapped all the fun out of climbing. 
I felt like I wasn't good enough, and if I couldn't be strong, why even pursue
climbing at all?
I seriously thought giving up the outdoors and climbing to move away
to the concrete jungle of subways and skyscrapers, to leave it all behind.

Then I went climbing in Japan's countryside and climbed without grade expectations.
Japan's grading system doesn't translate well to V-grades.
It was like "oh that's sho-dan" and I'd be like "okay might as well try it" since
sho-dan is anywhere between V6 to V8. I didn't worry about how hard I was climbing,
None of the people around me knew me or cared about how hard I could climb.
I couldn't talk to them anyways so why should I care what they think.
I just climbed because it was fun.

In Japan, my friend Mark told two things that stuck with me.
First, he would say ironically "Climbing is all about style, if you don't look cool while
climbing, why even climb at all."
Second, with a genuine smile he would say "I just like trying hard moves with the homies".

I'm glad I didn't give up climbing.
Now-a-days, I just have fun climbing.
If I don't send, it's okay. If I'm not climbing hard grades, it's okay.
I just want to be outside, at the crag, chilling with the homies, trying hard moves,
and having fun.

But I don't want to deny you, you're all entitled to having your own kind of fun,
even if it's the wrong kind of fun.
Grade chasing and ego climbing can be fun.
I won't deny that seeing grade progression is rewarding.
It's a sustainable source of fun so I encourage you to try having the right kind of fun.
