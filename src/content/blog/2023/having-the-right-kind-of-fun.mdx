I want to be good at the things I'm interested in but why do I want to be good at them?
External recognition, ego, is the easiest place to start. I want to be good because
I want other people to see that I'm good.

I fell into this early on in climbing.
I started climbing because my brother got me into climbing
but I kept climbing because people around me told me I was good at climbing.
At the gym, I was improving quickly, my grades kept going up and that got me psyched.

Climbing grades are the easiest metric to measure skill by.
A question I often get asked by new climbers is "What grade do you climb?".
The higher the grade you climb, the stronger a climber you are.
Being strong is a source of external validation to continue climbing.
Soon enough, I was comparing myself to the people I climbed with.
Was I getting climbs faster than them? Was I able to climb the same grades as them?
I wanted to be stronger, to get more external validation.

But then I wasn't as strong as them.
I kept chuffing on climbs my friends had done the year before.
My longtime climbing buddy started sending harder grades than me.
I seriously thought giving up climbing, just move the big city without a way
to the crag and leave it all behind.

Then I went climbing in Japan's countryside.
Japan's grading system doesn't translate well to V-grades.
It was like "oh that's sho-dan" and I'd be like "okay might as well try it" since
sho-dan is anywhere between V6 to V8. I didn't worry about how hard I was climbing,
I just climbed because it was fun.

In Japan, my friend Mark told two things that stuck with me.
First, sarcastically, he would say "Climbing is all about style, if you don't look cool while
climbing, why even climb at all."
Second, with a genuine smile he would say "I just like trying hard moves with the homies".

I'm glad I didn't give up climbing.
Now-a-days, I just have fun climbing.
It's okay if I don't send. It's okay if I'm not climbing hard grades.
Just going out to the crag, trying hard moves, and hanging out with my friends
is all I need.
It's hard, but I'm trying to disconnect my ego from my climbing.
I love climbing and I never want to have a mindset again that will lead me to wanting
to quit these rocks I love so dearly.

Grade chasing and ego climbing can be fun.
I won't deny that seeing grade progression is rewarding.
You're all entitled to having your own kind of fun,
even if it's the wrong kind of fun.
It's a sustainable source of fun so I encourage you to try having the right kind of fun.
