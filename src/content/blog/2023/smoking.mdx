Misery loves company.
A cigarette will keep you company.

I've been a smoker for years now.
It's off and on and off and on.
I tell myself I can quit whenever I want.

It's lonely being a smoker.
It's frowned upon to be a smoker.

I'll go outside to smoke, away from the circles of chatter.
I'll go outside to smoke, in the cold and rainy evening.
I'll go outside to smoke, climbing atop a forlorn rooftop.
I'll go outside to smoke, hidden among cars in a lot.

in, out, tickles the throat

in, out, fresh air in-between

glowing, grief, regret

I smoke when I want to feel something.
It's my version of self harm.

Just put as many blockers between me and nicotine okay?
Roll your own cigarettes, that's three more things you have to carry.
Don't vape... you can do that indoors, it's too easy; nothing so bad should taste so good.
Learn the taste of tobacco.
And hot ash singeing my fingertips.

Don't smoke cigarettes.
It won't do you any good.
It'll rot your bones.

Maybe I'll finally give it up this time.
