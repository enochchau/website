I've been traveling a lot in the last six months.
My travel setup consists of a grinder, Aeropress, and a small scale, although I'm trying to travel lighter in the future.
These coffee bags more or less represent my travels.

I'd been talking forever about going to New York, so I decided on a whim to spend February there.
My second day in Manhattan's Chinatown, I went to the closest coffee roaster and bought
the 'Coto Brus' bag from Artbean Coffee Roasters.
It wasn't exactly my cup of coffee but it helped me through the not-so-cold-to-a-New-Yorker-but-very-cold-to-a-Cali-boy
month of February.
Besides Artbean, I picked up the bag of Devoción beans just a few days before coming back to the Bay Area.
These were probably some of my favorite beans. The Devoción shop in Williamsburg is a nice place but
it does get [a bit crowded](/blog/2023/best-place-for-remote-work) on any given day.

In March, I went to climb in Red Rocks which coincidentally overlapped with my birthday.
We picked up the bag of 'Bonde' from Vesta Roasters on the way to the crag one day.
Remote work has enabled me to live the 'travel + work + climb' life fairly consistently for
the last year and a half. I'm very lucky to be in a situation where I can
both build a career and pursue my personal passions.

Speaking of traveling, in late March, I took off on a six week ordeal, going from Taiwan to Vietnam and ending in Japan.
Simple Kaffa was the first of many coffee shops I visited in Taipei.
At times I wished I hadn't bought that bag, not because it wasn't tasty but
because I would have liked to spend my caffeine budget checking out the countless
coffee shops of Taipei.

In Vietnam, I started off with visiting my Aunties and Uncles in Saigon.
Of course, I indulged in my fair share of cà phê sữa.
Then going up north to Hanoi, I learned to produce the illustrious, dangerously rich,
egg coffee.
On my last day in Hanoi, I visited Dream Beans Coffee to try some
Third Wave Vietnamese coffee.
I talked with Long and Duc, the two baristas, about the up and coming third wave coffee scene in Vietnam.
Most coffee grown in Vietnam is Robusta but Dream Beans is bringing attention to Vietnamese Arabica.
Robust is ingrained in Vietnamese culture but the younger folk are starting to take to the
complex flavors of Arabica.
I'm hoping that Vietnam can really take off in the next few years
and join the likes of an Ethiopia or Colombia on the world coffee stage.

I love talking to other coffee enthusiasts like Long and Duc.
It's good fun to talk about different brew methods, compare gear,
discuss brew methods, and just share in the joy of our addiction.
