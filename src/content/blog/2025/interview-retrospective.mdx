title: Interview Retrospective
date: 5 September 2025
tags: ["dev"]
---

After visiting Seattle in July, I noticed that many of my college friends working in big tech had bought or were buying homes.
Seattle is slightly cheaper than San Francisco but it gave me hope that maybe someday I could save up enough money for home ownership.
If only I could income max over the next few years.
Around this time, I also started getting a bunch of recruiter emails, 
probably something to do with the improving economic situation in the tech and Venture Capital (VC) sectors.
As a result, over the last month and a half, I decided to take every single recruiter call
and do every single interview with the goal to use them primarily as practice, but also just
to test the water.

First, I emailed back every recruiter that had emailed me in the months of June and July to setup initial calls.
Some of them got back to me, some of them ghosted me. 
The worst one was one who tried to reschedule twice before ghosting me.
These were all third party recruiters who shopped my resume around to different startups, 
some of which turned me down, others decided to move forward.
Besides the external recruiters, I also reached out to the Director of Engineering at [Fermat](https://www.fermatcommerce.com/)
since I went to their Series C party through an invitation from an ex-coworker.
I was also contacted by the internal recruiter for [Imbue](https://imbue.com/).

These initial screenings helped me to formulate a script as well as organize my motivations for seeking a new job.
Basically, I got really good at bullshitting people to make myself sound like I was the best fit for their company.
The goal at this point was to get through the initial screen so I could get practice on technical interviews.

Around this time, I also started doing technical interview prep.
I replaced my video-game time with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (LC) practice.
I replaced my TikTok scrolling with System Design YouTube shorts.
I was surprised by how much easier it is to learn and relearn computer science fundamentals today in the age of short form content.
I may have learned more in breadth of system design from YouTube shorts than I ever did from working as a software engineer.

For first-round technical screens, these were the questions I got with each respective company:

## Imbue
I was expected to setup my own local environment to conduct the interview.
No AI coding tools were allowed and I screen shared with a third party interview proctor.

<details>
<summary>Is Valid Word & Scrabble</summary>

### 1. Is Valid word

Read this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonbcard/scrabble-bot/master/src/dictionary.txt and create a function that can check if a word is valid
### 2. All Valid Words

Given a string, return all valid words from the combination of the letters

ADD -> [ 'DAD', 'AD', 'ADD' ]

### 3. Is Valid Board

Given a scrabble board that is 15x15: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bawr/460fdadd7e6c301471596e3b2f6ed90b/raw/296de5b6ad40050748f166832675b94b2c900db6/boards.txt

Check if its valid:

- There is a tile in the center
- All words are connected
- All words are valid words
- words are read from left to right, up to down

</details>

Pretty standard leetcode style assessment. 
I'm guessing that they would have given this as an online assessment (OA) before the age of LLMs.

## Fermat

<details>
<summary>Write a function spiral(n) that generates and prints a spiral pattern on an n × n grid.</summary>

#### Specs

- The spiral begins at the top-left corner (0,0) of the grid
- The initial direction of the spiral is rightward (east)
- The spiral follows this pattern:
    - Draw a line segment of length n going east (right)
    - Turn 90 degrees clockwise (to south/down)
    - Draw a line segment of length n-1
    - Turn 90 degrees clockwise (to west/left)
    - Draw a line segment of length n-2
    - Turn 90 degrees clockwise (to north/up)
    - Draw a line segment of length n-3
    - Continue this pattern, reducing the length after every turn
    - Stop when the remaining length becomes 0

#### Example

For spiral(10), the output should be:
```
OOOOOOOOOO
.........O
..OOOOOO.O
..O....O.O
..O.OO.O.O
..O.O..O.O
..O.OOOO.O
..O......O
..OOOOOOOO
..........
```
</details>

This was less like an OA since I did it with a member of their engineering team.

## Roger Healthcare

I was given an example repo and told to implement some features within 1 hour.
These features were basically impossible to implement for a human within the given
time frame and the candidate was expected to vibe code.

<details>
<summary>Tasks</summary>

### 1. Refactor Using Question Schema

Right now the form has a hardcoded set of 5 questions. However we
want it to be more dynamic so the questions can be easily changed.
1. Download this containing 90 questions
2. Change the frontend and backend code so that all question-specific code is now based on the schema rather than hardcoded
to specific questions

### 2. AI Context Splitting
We suspect that AI performance will degrade with very large question
schemas (e.g. hundreds of questions). Split the LLM call up so that all
questions are not corrected in one single big call to the LLM.

### 3. Job Queue Refactor
The backend code uses the asynchronous job queue library `arq` to run
the LLM calls in a non-blocking way. `arq` has some advantages but it
is not the best-maintained library and our team wishes to move to a
more mainstream tool, `celery`.
Help us migrate the code from arq to celery for the async operations
while maintaining exactly the same end user experience.
Note that Celery can be configured to use Redis as its message queue,
meaning that you shouldn’t need to set up any other dependencies.

### 4. New AI Objective: Medical Consistency Fix
Rather than fixing the answers’ grammar and spelling, we want the AI to
fix something else instead now: adjust answers so that all of them paint
a picture of the same patient.consistent

> ⚠ For example, if one question says the patient takes insulin and
the other says they have no signs of diabetes at all, this looks
like an inconsistency.

Create an AI workflow to make the minimal fixes necessary to make all
the answers consistent.

### 5. Consistency Check Splitting
The consistency check is more complicated than grammar check,
because grammar could be fixed on each question independently of the others. 
This is not true of consistency - we want the entire set of
answers to form a cohesive whole.
Suppose the input schema had thousands of questions and again was
too big for one LLM call. Come up with an improved splitting strategy
for this case.
</details>

This was a fun one and very reflective of their engineering culture as an AI first company.
It was pretty funny to feed the prompts into Copilot and just sit back and watch the clock tick down.
I eventually had to bring in the big guns with Claude Code to get it across the finish line.

## Loop

This was a phone call with one of the engineers along with Coder Pad.

<details>
<summary>[Time Based Key Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/)</summary>

The problem was read to me and none of the constraints were given.
I was only provided with example inputs and outputs.

</details>

Seemed to be a pretty generic LC question on the surface but later I realized
that I failed hard because I did not clarify constraints before starting on the solution.
The weird part was that it was a phone call and I could have easily googled or 
used an LLM to solve the problem.

## Stepwork

While this was a first round technical assessment, it was also the only technical assessment.
It was conducted by a third party interviewer that [Stepwork](https://www.stepwork.com/) 
had found through a VC connection.
It was split into three parts: coding, knowledge, and system design.

<details>
<summary>Coding</summary>

Write tic tac toe as a CLI program in whatever language you're comfortable in.

1. Draw the board, use a Class
2. Create a simple AI that will play any valid move
3. Allow user input with validation
4. Win condition
5. Advanced AI
</details>

The knowledge portion felt like random trivia. 
I was asked about database optimizations, cryptography, https and some other random things.
It was very strange because I was sitting in front of my computer and could have easily googled any of the questions.

The system design question was a high level of "Design Ticket Master".

I've written tic tac toe a bunch of times as toy programs when learning new languages.
Take that as you will.

---

I moved forward with all the companies but was rejected by Loop.
The [Loop](https://www.loop.com/) interview was a good experience because it highlighted my naivete 
with respect to constraints on LC problems whereas with a real world problem, I would have been much more thorough.
Overall, most of the interviews seemed to take into account that candidates could use
AI to cheat on LC style questions.

For second-round interviews, each company upped the ante with harder LC questions, system design,
and live coding.

## Imbue 

I was given three LC hard questions to choose from and then collaborated with one of 
their engineers to try to solve it.
The problem I tried was Magician Tour.

<details>
<summary>Magician Tour</summary>

You are a magician who has two different shows. 
You are planning a tour of a series of cities. 
Given the population of each city and the roads between cities, you must plan the tour such that no two cities directly connected by a road are assigned the same show and such that the difference between the number of people who see show 1 and those who see show 2 is minimized. 
You have to return the difference between the number of people who will see show 1 and those who will see show 2.

The roads between the cities are specified in the String[] roads. roads[i][j] is '1' if there is a road between the ith and jth cities and is '0' if there is no road. You are guaranteed that you can pull this off. (You can schedule the shows such that no two adjacent cities are assigned the same show.) Keep in mind that each city must be assigned one of the two shows. The population of each city is specified by the int[] populations whose ith element is the population of the ith city.

### Definition

**Class:**
MagicianTour

**Method:**
bestDifference

**Parameters:**
String[], int[]

**Returns:**
int

**Method signature:**
int bestDifference(String[] roads, int[] populations)
(be sure your method is public)

### Notes
You, the magician, can travel between two cities regardless of whether or not they are connected by a road.

### Constraints
- populations contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
- roads contains exactly n elements, each of which has exactly n characters, where n is the number of elements in populations.
- Each element of populations will be between 0 and 20, inclusive.
- Each element of roads will only contain the characters '0' and '1'.
- You are guaranteed that you can schedule the shows such that no two adjacent cities are assigned the same show.
- No city will have a road to itself.
- The graph is undirected. Hence, if there is a road from city a to city b then there has to be a road from city b to city a. As a result, roads[i][j] and roads[j][i] must be the same.

### Examples
```
1. {"01","10"}
{15,20}
Returns: 5
There are two cities of populations 15 and 20. Perform show 1 in the first and show 2 in the second or vice versa.
{"0100", "1000", "0001", "0010"}
{2,4,1,5}
Returns: 2

2. {"0100", "1000", "0001", "0010"}
{2,4,2,4}
Returns: 0
There are four cities of populations 2, 4, 2 and 4. Perform show 1 in the first and fourth cities and perform show 2 in the second and third cities.
{"001 0", "0001", "1000", "0100"}
{ 2,2,2,2}   
Returns: 0

3. {"000", "000", "000"}
{6,7,15}
Returns: 2
There are no roads! To keep it balanced, perform show 1 in the first and second cities and show 2 in the third city.

4. {"0000", "0010", "0101", "0010"}
{8,10,15,10}
Returns: 3
```
</details>

This was very challenging and we discussed at length different methods to solve the problem.
We never reached the coding portion.

## Fermat

This was a system design round.
I was asked to design a website builder and deployment solution for said websites.
I've worked on a website builder before so it was fun to delve into the parts
of a website builder and the infrastructure that I hadn't really thought about before.

## Roger Healthcare

I met virtually with one of the founders and was presented with some example code.
I was asked to implement simple rate limiting.

<details>
<summary>Rate Limiting</summary>

### Case 1: 
Every user can send 10 messages every day.

### Case 2:
Every user can send 10 messages in a 24 hour window.

</details>

I read [a post](https://smudge.ai/blog/ratelimit-algorithms) on Hacker News about
different rate limiting algorithms before so I was well prepared.

---

Of these, I was rejected from [Roger Healthcare](https://www.rogerhealthcare.com/) and Imbue.
Imbue gave me detailed feedback about my interview and also offered me a second
chance which I eventually turned down.
Roger Healthcare sent me a generic rejection email but if I had to guess the reason, it
may have been something I said about vibe coding.

I had one final round with Fermat where we reviewed my past projects.
After that, I had two weeks of radio silence before they finally responded
saying they had up-leveled the position I was applying for and removed me from the pipeline.
Seemed like a huge waste of time for both them and me but it was likely coming from top down.

Rejections are always hard to take but I appreciate Imbue for being transparent and
giving good feedback on what I could improve on.
Thankfully, I actually got rejection emails from all of them.
In the past, I've talked to startups who have ghosted me after one or two rounds.

As for recruiters, there were two that I would like to highlight.

Gabriel Nadj and Aaditya Jain at Employia did an excellent job with my initial screening.
Both are recruiters but Aaditya seemed to have a technical background so I could
go into more depth about my experience instead of giving a high-level overview as I normally
would to a non-technical person.

Zen Mak at RallyWorks had a personal touch that I wasn't used to but came to 
greatly appreciate.
Typically, I try to distance myself from recruiters and interviewers as interviewing can be dehumanizing at times.
With this in mind, I was initially confused by Zen's friendliness but it eventually overcame me.

Throughout the past month and a half, I would sometimes wake up to my heart pounding with anxiety.
I was averaging 5 calls a week, sometimes multiple technical interviews back to back. 
Talking to someone new everyday, turning on the charm, and having to constantly repeat the same introduction to the recruiter, and in subsequent rounds of interviewing was exhausting.
Technical interviews were also mentally draining, I would leave the interview feeling defeated, even if I did well.
My only reprieve was the climbing gym where I could disconnect from my work life and hang out with my friends.
Around this time, I was also searching for a new apartment.
The summer rental market was brutal.
I spent hundreds of dollars and received multiple rejections as the AI startup boom and Return to Office began jacking up rent across the city.
I realized that I didn't have to do this to myself so I started winding down interviews.

I'm still getting recruiter emails but I've stopped responding for the time being.
I got a lot of good practice with interviewing on both soft and hard skills.
I've also realized that my original goal of income maxing for home ownership was kind of pointless
and that a job is much more than the dollar amount it provides.

I met my girlfriend's uncle while we were in Seattle and he gave us a tour of his office.
He would smile and say "Hi" to all his coworkers as we walked through the halls.
We ended the tour on the rooftop overlooking Bellevue. 
He remarked that he'd been working there for more than ten years and that he really loved his job.
I want a job like that, somewhere I can work and love to work for that long.
