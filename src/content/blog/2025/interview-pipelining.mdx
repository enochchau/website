For first round, I interviewed with one company that was basically a moderated OA where they hired a third party interviewer to just watch me to make sure I didn't cheat with LLMs.

I did one interview with an AI first company where the take home was to complete 5 features, which you basically could not do in the given time frame unless you vibe coded.

There was one really weird one where I did a leetcode medium with a guy but
it was over the phone with coder pad but no screen share so I basically could have cheated.

One of the better interviews I've done was one where I was given some example code and
then told to implement some features.

I like this style because it evaluates how well a candidate can read code and build on existing code instead of just writing new code.

If I had to come up with my own interview pipeline now I'd do:
1. leetcode easy - 2 Sum or similar that tests looping and maps, avoiding O(n^2) runtime. This comes up a lot in our code base when we map over data so it's important.
2. System design - gets a feel for their level of seniority and what kind of technologies they are familiar with
3. Pair programming - complete a feature on some example code while working with an engineer. This would give a really good idea of what it's like to work with this person.

And at some point, do a behavioral assessment just to vibe check them.
I feel like take-homes now-a-days are too easy to vibe code and may not show
the candidates true strengths.
I mentioned to Binoy that live coding a feature to a take-home could be a good challenge as an add-on but he mentioned that it would be hard to standardize.
I also think it wouldn't test how good they are at reading code since it's still code they wrote and not someone else.
