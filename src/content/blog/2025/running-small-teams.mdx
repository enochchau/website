I recently ended my tenure at [Gatsby](https://welcome.gatsby.events/) after four years.
Throughout that time, I went from being a junior engineer with less than a year of
professional experience, to a senior member of the team, responsible for multiple
product surfaces.
I've seen many projects through to completion and into maintenance and felt first hand
the results of my mistakes.
Throughout this time, I've picked up some of my own learning about how a small team should be run.

There were three people who impacted my cultural understanding the most.
Our co-founder Michael, senior engineer Hugh, and product designer Andy.
Each of them had their own styles of working that would at times clash with one another.
While I don't agree with all of them, I did use the culture they built to formulate
my own understanding.

Michael and Hugh were the antithesis of each other.
Michael's philosophy was quick and dirty. Do what the customer needs as quickly 
as possible. Don't spend too much time on planning, execution is more important.
Hugh was more process heavy. He pushed for daily stand ups, sprint planning and
design docs. While this made sure everyone was always on the same page, everything
took longer to finish.

I mostly agree with Michael: Small teams don't need process. 
Process is only as important as the increase in efficiency it provides from improving communication.
Why spend time in meetings when there are only 2-3 people working together who
can talk to each other directly.
Daily stand-ups are good but should be isolated to people who work together on the same team.
For example, I don't need to hear about what sales is doing, but I do need to keep track
of what my engineering teammates are doing, or if there is an update to the design or product
specification.
The rule of thumb is: don't waste people's time.

Hugh wanted to be an engineering manager, but small teams don't need engineering managers.
What you do need is a single point of contact between Engineering and Product such as an Engineering Lead.
The lead can understand the current progress of the engineering team and translate these
into accurate time lines for the Product team.
Individuals should still be able to circumvent the Engineering lead. 
For example, the designer should be able to work directly with the frontend engineer
to tweak the user interface.
Nevertheless, the Lead is the primary point of contact to communicate with other stakeholders.

Andy liked to ideate, having the engineers create demos, then tweaking and sometimes
overhauling his original designs. This resulted in longer development cycles and
"wasted" engineer hours but usually ended up with more polish and better UX.

I would not spend too much time on the initial designs.
Get the product working and ship it to users.
If you're afraid of releasing an unpolished product, find a group of core users
who are willing to beta test.
You should also test internally, dogfood and tweak but don't spend too much time polishing.
Using your own product is the best way to make a better product.

To recap, small teams only need as much process to communicate effectively.
Individuals should work directly with each other when it makes sense but there
still needs to be a single point of contact for other stakeholders.
Don't spend too much time tweaking the product or trying to cover every use case. 
Using the product is the best way to find it's deficiencies.

These are effective ideas for running a small team but they also need to be paired
with guidelines to avoid burnout.
With a lack of process, comes a murkiness of job responsibilities and a feeling of
uncertainty around job performance.
In turn, I would tie the performance of the company directly to my job performance.
Working more doesn't always lead to burnout; burnout is a combination of long hours with meaningless work.
Individuals need to be excited, to feel like they're building towards something bigger.
Their ideas need to be heard, even bad ideas need to be considered, even if they are never
ultimately never implemented.
This can be done with tact and professionalism, detaching emotions from ideas and focusing
on the truth of what makes the product better.
Find people who have low egos and can give and take criticism freely.
Talk to people in person, we can communicate much more with our body language and facial expressions than
we can with text.

Finally, keep your team small, for as long as you can.
Many startup founders have this itch to play house, to build a team and act like they're a "real company".
Only hire for what you need to meet your next goal.
It's like the engineering principle [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) (ya ain't gonna need it), 
don't waste time and money on preemptively hiring people you don't currently need.
