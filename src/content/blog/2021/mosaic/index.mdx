Mosaic is a user based full stack web app made using MongoDB, Express.js,
Node.js and React.js. On Mosaic, you can create mosaic style images from a base
image or from randomly generated rgb pixel values.

My inspiration was to make something artistic using only CSS and HTML elements.
I considered using the HTML canvas element but instead went with using div
elements because of it's customizability with CSS

In the database, the mosaics are represented as a 2D array of RGB pixel objects
with other customization data. I originally chose to use PostgreSQL but that was
restrictive on adding more customization options for the mosaics. Using MongoDB
allows me to continue to expand options and tools for the mosaics without having
to overhaul the databse.

To implement users, I used JSON web tokens (JWT) to protect client side routes
and API end points from unauthorized users. Local storage and session storage
hold the JWT on the client side. Using local storage allows me to parse the JWT
to personalize content according to the current users information. I considered
using cookies to store the JWT but then I wouldn't be able to safely access the
JWT on the client side. Also I don't want to get sued by the EU.
