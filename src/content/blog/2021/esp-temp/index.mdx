Recently, I made an IoT temperature probe. It shows data physically over a seven
segment display but it can also stream data over WiFi using MQTT.

At first I didn't really know what I could use it for, but it's come in handy
for MQTT testing. The probe gives me an easy way to start an MQTT publisher. I
mean, I could just write a script to do that, but that's not cool. Besides, hand
wiring is fun... right?
