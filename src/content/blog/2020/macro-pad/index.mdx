I can't quite remember how I got into mechanical keyboards... but they sure are
pretty. I have to find ways to use my Electrical Engineering degree somehow, so
I figured it'd be fun to make my own keyboard. I'm currently using a 60%
keyboard and I was feeling the need for a numpad.

My design uses a [ProMicro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) as the
controller because I wanted the whole thing to be relatively easy to hand
solder. The ProMicro is also compatible with
[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), an open source keyboard firmware.
