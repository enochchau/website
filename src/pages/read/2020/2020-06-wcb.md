Water Cooler Buddy is an energy management system for a water cooler. Water
Cooler Buddy controls it's sensors, relays, and user interface using an ESP32
microcontroller.

My primary contribution was firmware development. I updated firmware for ESP32
implementation and created an RTOS scheduling system. I also assisted with PCB
population and water cooler wiring.
