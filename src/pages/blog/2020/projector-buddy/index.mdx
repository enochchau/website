Projector Buddy is an advanced energy system that controls a projectors
electricity usage based on human presence in the room. Human activity is
determined through light, sound, and motion. In order to preserve the projectors
internal electronics and bulb, a soft shutdown is initiated using an IR blaster.

My primary contribution was firmware development. I implemented freeRTOS
firmware, updated the control algorithm, and created IR Receiver and IR Emitter
functionality.
