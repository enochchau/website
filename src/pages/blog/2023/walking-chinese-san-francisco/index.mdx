_Noreiga >> Irving >> Golden Gate Park >> Balboa >> Golden Gate Park >> Noreiga_

I take a brisk walk, two blocks, down the hill to the dentist office on the corner.
I'm rushing, I'm five minutes late, I hate being late, I don't want to let down
the dentist, the receptionist, especially after the bombardment of reminders in the
week leading up to my appointment.

My dentist today is Dr. Lee. It's always a different dentist. 
The head dentist who owns the practice has a rotating cast of trainees and recent
graduates that come through, never staying more than the 6 months between my appointments.
She tries to talk to me.
I get it, it's good to build a doctor and patient relationship, but again, 
I'll probably be seeing someone new in 6 months.

I've been at the same practice for the last 20 odd years.
The same dentist, Dr. Louie.
His daughter, Dr. Jackie, might take up the practice after he retires so maybe
I'll still be here in another 20 years.

The place hasn't aged a day since my childhood, besides the introduction of some
plastic shields (standard COVID procedure).
Still the same four waiting room chairs, none of which I've ever seen fully occupied.
Still the same over head light, now with rusted bolts.
Intrusive thoughts invade my mind as Dr. Lee prods my gums. 
I wonder if that thing might fall off it's adjustable track and crush my balls.

It's lunch time.
My dental insurance doesn't cover fluoride anymore so no more waiting a half hour
before I can eat.
No location in mind, just looking for something good on Irving.

San Francisco's Sunset district is kinda like the second Chinatown in San Francisco.
Noreiga is one part, Irving is another, Judah and Taraval round it out.
I stick out a bit, the one younger Asian dude in a throng of older Chinese folk.
A lot of people are out today, likely shopping for the upcoming Lunar New Year.

Lunch comes with a bowl of soup.
Do you drink your soup before or after the meal?
I've always asked this question and there's no consistent consensus.
Usually, at restaurants, soup comes first, probably because it's quick to make.
At home, soup usually comes after the meal, but that also changes from time to time.
