Today we're building the [Ploopy Classic](https://github.com/ploopyco/classic-trackball).
I've been following [Ploopy](https://ploopy.co/) for a bit now.
I first found out about them through one of the mechanical keyboard subreddits.
All their mice use [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) which is a popular firmware for hobby mechanical keyboards.

My wrist has been hurting lately.
A combination of long hours at the computer mixed with strenuous climbing
will do that to you.
Well, I'm not going to stop climbing so I might as well get a more ergonomic mouse.

The kit I got requires some assembly.

In college, I worked at a research lab where I did my fair [share](/blog/2019/3phase) of [electronics](/blog/2020/wcb) [assembly](/blog/2020/projector-buddy)
so I'm comfortable with soldering.
Did I also mention I've [made](/blog/2020/macro-pad) a [few](/blog/2021/gis) of my own [keyboards](/blog/2020/fk-2001)?

The PCB setup in the base is looking good.
The grey plastic piece is the scroll wheel holder.
Initially, I had a bit of trouble with the press fit because I didn't press it into the PCB hard enough.

Side buttons in place.
For some reason, I got two sets of side buttons.
Must have been a shipping mistake on their end.

The scroll wheel is smooth and not stepped.
I liked stepped wheels.
I'll probably end up using the 
[firmware option](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ploopyco/trackball#drag-scroll)
to use the trackball for scrolling.

All the buttons are on now.

These are the bearings for the trackball.
There's a little jig to push the rods through.

It took a bit of effort to put the top on as it's finicky to get around the mouse buttons.

All done!

I also setup my own [mouse keymap](https://github.com/ec965/qmk_firmware/blob/d872a5d7681fde8ce52713bc3a8c71779f47d28f/keyboards/ploopyco/trackball/keymaps/ec965/keymap.c) 
[config](https://github.com/ec965/qmk_firmware/blob/d872a5d7681fde8ce52713bc3a8c71779f47d28f/keyboards/ploopyco/trackball/keymaps/ec965/config.h) through QMK.
The default options make configuration really easy.

One problem I did run into was that I couldn't get `LT` to work with `KC_BTN5`.
The 
[demo keymap](https://github.com/ec965/qmk_firmware/blob/d872a5d7681fde8ce52713bc3a8c71779f47d28f/keyboards/ploopyco/trackball/keymaps/drag_scroll/keymap.c)
for drag scroll shows the 5th mouse button used as `LT(1, KC_BTN5)` but in practice this doesn't work.
The QMK docs mention a [caveat](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_layers?id=caveats) 
around `LT` where you can only use keycodes in the [basic keycode set](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes_basic),
which `KC_BTN5` is not a part of.
This was a bit of a bummer since I really would have liked all 4 mouse buttons to always be tap functional
rather than having a dedicated layer toggle key.
It's okay though, can't have your cake and eat it too.

I ended up using the right button as a layer toggle.
This layer includes the drag scroll toggle, DPI toggle, and mouse button 5.

Getting used to the trackball has been entertaining.
I had to scale down the DPI a whole lot from the default 1200DPI to 400DPI.
My hand precision and dexterity are shaky at best and it only gets worse after coffee.
Being a surgeon was ruled out real early in my life.

I'll see if I stick with using this mouse as a daily driver.
The location of the mouse buttons is very different from a traditional mouse so it will definitely take some time to get used to. 
I also keep accidentally touching the mouse wheel.

I wonder if I'll be any good at FPS or League with this thing.
