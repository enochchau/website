What is it about photos of humans that are so captivating?
When I see a photo, I like to imagine the story behind the frame.
Imagine all the pain, happiness, hopes, and dreams behind that person.

Photos of things can be beautiful, but they aren't relatable.
Things don't change, they aren't alive.
They have no emotions or wants, they might have stories, but usually
not as interesting as a living being.
